  Summary:
    Opens a presentation socket.

  Description:
    Provides a unified method for opening all presentation sockets types. Sockets 
	are created at the presentation layer module initialization, and can be claimed 
	with this function and freed using NET_PRES_SKT_Close.
    The presentation layer will call the corresponding open function in the transport 
	layer, and if encryption is specified the presentation layer will also handle 
	encryption negotiation.

  Precondition:
    MPLAB Harmony Networking Presentation Layer is initialized.

  Parameters:
    index          - Index of the presentation layer
    socketType     - The type of socket to open.
    addType        - The type of address being used. This is passed unaltered to the 
	                 transport layer.
    port           - The port to listen or to send to.  This is passed unaltered to 
	                 the transport layer.
    addr           - Address to use. This is passed unaltered to the transport layer.
    error          - The extended error code of the function

  Returns:
    - NET_PRES_INVALID_SOCKET      - No sockets of the specified type were available to be
                                     opened
    - NET_PRES_SKT_HANDLE_T handle - Returned when NET_PRES_INVALID_SOCKET is returned. Save 
	                                 this handle and use it when calling all other presentation 
								     socket APIs.
