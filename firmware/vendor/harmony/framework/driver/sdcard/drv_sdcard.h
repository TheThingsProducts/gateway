/* SDCARD Driver command handle.

  Summary:
    Handle identifying commands queued in the driver.

  Description:
    A command handle is returned by a call to the Read or Write 
    functions. This handle allows the application to track the completion
    of the operation. This command handle is also returned to the client
    along with the event that has occurred with respect to the command.
    This allows the application to connect the event to a specific
    command in case where multiple commands are queued.

    The command handle associated with the command request expires when the
    client has been notified of the completion of the command (after event
    handler function that notifies the client returns) or after the command
    has been retired by the driver if no event handler callback was set. 

  Remarks:
    None.

/* SDCARD Driver Event Handler Function Pointer

   Summary
    Pointer to a SDCARDDriver Event handler function

   Description
    This data type defines the required function signature for the SDCARD event
    handling callback function. A client must register a pointer to an event
    handling function whose function signature (parameter and return value 
    types) match the types specified by this function pointer in order to 
    receive event calls back from the driver.
    
    The parameters and return values are described here and a partial example
    implementation is provided.

  Parameters:
    event           - Identifies the type of event
    
    commandHandle   - Handle returned from the Read/Write requests
    
    context         - Value identifying the context of the application that
                      registered the event handling function

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    void APP_MySDCARDEventHandler
    (
        DRV_SDCARD_EVENT event,
        DRV_SDCARD_COMMAND_HANDLE commandHandle,
        uintptr_t context
    )
    {
        MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT pAppData = (MY_APP_DATA_STRUCT) context;
        
        switch(event)
        {
            case DRV_SDCARD_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE:

                // Handle the completed buffer. 
                break;
            
            case DRV_SDCARD_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR:
            default:

                // Handle error.
                break;
        }
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    If the event is DRV_SDCARD_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE, it means that the
    write or a erase operation was completed successfully. 
    
    If the event is DRV_SDCARD_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR, it means that the scheduled
    operation was not completed successfully.
     
    The context parameter contains the handle to the client context, provided
    at the time the event handling function was  registered using the
    DRV_SDCARD_EventHandlerSet function. This context handle value is
    passed back to the client as the "context" parameter.  It can be any value
    necessary to identify the client context or instance (such as a pointer to
    the client's data) instance of the client that made the read/write/erase
    request.

	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine initializes the SD Card driver, making it ready for clients to
    open and use the driver.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex        - Index for the driver instance to be initialized

    init            - Pointer to a data structure containing any data necessary
                      to initialize the driver.

  Returns:
    If successful, returns a valid handle to a driver object. Otherwise, it
    returns SYS_MODULE_OBJ_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>

  Remarks:
    This function can be called multiple times to reinitialize the module.

    This operation can be used to refresh any supported hardware registers as
    specified by the initialization data or to change the power state of the
    module.

    This routine will NEVER block for hardware access. If the operation requires

  Remarks:
    Once the Initialize operation has been called, the Deinitialize operation
    must be called before the Initialize operation can be called again.

    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware. If the operation
    requires time to allow the hardware to complete, this will be reported by

                                is ready to accept new operations.

    SYS_STATUS_BUSY           - Indicates that the driver is busy with a
                                previous system level operation and cannot start
                                another

    SYS_STATUS_ERROR          - Indicates that the driver is in an error state

                                Note:  Any value less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR is
                                also an error state.

    SYS_MODULE_DEINITIALIZED  - Indicates that the driver has been deinitialized

                                Note:  This value is less than SYS_STATUS_ERROR

  Example:
    <code>
    SYS_MODULE_OBJ      object;     // Returned from DRV_SDCARD_Initialize
    SYS_STATUS          status;

    status = DRV_SDCARD_Status(object);

    }
    else if (SYS_STATUS_ERROR >= status)
    {
        // Handle error
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    This operation can be used to determine when any of the driver's module
    level operations has completed.

    If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_BUSY, then a previous operation
    has not yet completed. If the status operation returns SYS_STATUS_READY,
    then it indicates that all previous operations have completed.

    The value of SYS_STATUS_ERROR is negative (-1).  Any value less than that is
    also an error state.

    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the Status operation returns an error value, the error may be cleared by
    calling the reinitialize operation. If that fails, the deinitialize
    operation will need to be called, followed by the initialize operation to
    return to normal operations.

    Function DRV_SDCARD_Initialize must have been called before calling this
    function.

  Parameters:
    drvIndex    - Identifier for the object instance to be opened

    intent      - Zero or more of the values from the enumeration
                  DRV_IO_INTENT "ORed" together to indicate the intended use
                  of the driver

  Returns:
    If successful, the routine returns a valid open-instance handle (a number
    identifying both the caller and the module instance).

    If an error occurs, the return value is DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE  handle;

    handle = DRV_SDCARD_Open (DRV_SDCARD_INDEX_0, DRV_IO_INTENT_EXCLUSIVE);

    if (DRV_HANDLE_INVALID == handle)
    {
        // Unable to open the driver
    }
    </code>

  Remarks:
    The handle returned is valid until the DRV_SDCARD_Close routine is called.

    This routine will NEVER block waiting for hardware.

    If the DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING is requested and the driver was built
    appropriately to support blocking behavior, then other client-level
    operations may block waiting on hardware until they are complete.

    If the requested intent flags are not supported, the routine will return
    DRV_HANDLE_INVALID.

  Summary:
    Closes an opened-instance of the SD Card driver.
	<p><b>Implementation:</b> Dynamic</p>

  Description:
    This routine closes an opened-instance of the SD Card driver, invalidating
    the handle.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SDCARD_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified
    SD Card driver instance.

    DRV_SDCARD_Open must have been called to obtain a valid opened device
    handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open routine

  Returns:
    None

  Example:
    <code>
    DRV_HANDLE handle;  // Returned from DRV_SDCARD_Open

    DRV_SDCARD_Close (handle);
    </code>

  Remarks:
    After calling this routine, the handle passed in "handle" must not be used
    with any of the remaining driver routines.  A new handle must be obtained by
    calling DRV_SDCARD_Open before the caller may use the driver again.

    If DRV_IO_INTENT_BLOCKING was requested and the driver was built
    appropriately to support blocking behavior call may block until the
    operation is complete.

    If DRV_IO_INTENT_NON_BLOCKING request the driver client can call the
    DRV_SDCARD_Status operation to find out when the module is in
    the ready state (the handle is no longer valid).

    Note:
    Usually there is no need for the driver client to verify that the Close
    operation has completed.

  Summary:
    Reads blocks of data from the specified block address of the SD Card.

  Description:
    This function schedules a non-blocking read operation for reading blocks
    of data from the SD Card. The function returns with a valid buffer handle
    in the commandHandle argument if the read request was scheduled successfully.
    The function adds the request to the hardware instance queue and returns
    immediately. While the request is in the queue, the application buffer is
    owned by the driver and should not be modified. The function returns 
    DRV_SDCARD_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID in the commandHandle argument under the 
    following circumstances:
    - if the driver handle is invalid
    - if the target buffer pointer is NULL
    - if the number of blocks to be read is zero or more than the actual number
      of blocks available
    - if a buffer object could not be allocated to the request
    - if the client opened the driver in write only mode

    If the requesting client registered an event callback with the driver, the
    driver will issue a DRV_SDCARD_EVENT_COMMAND_COMPLETE event if the
    buffer was processed successfully or DRV_SDCARD_EVENT_COMMAND_ERROR
    event if the buffer was not processed successfully.

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SDCARD_Initialize routine must have been called for the specified SDCARD 
    driver instance.

    DRV_SDCARD_Open must have been called with DRV_IO_INTENT_READ or 
    DRV_IO_INTENT_READWRITE as the ioIntent to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle        - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                    open function

    commandHandle - Pointer to an argument that will contain the return buffer
                    handle

    blockStart    - Start block address of the SD Card from where the read should begin.

    nBlock        - Total number of blocks to be read.

  Returns:
    The buffer handle is returned in the commandHandle argument. It will be
    DRV_SDCARD_COMMAND_HANDLE_INVALID if the request was not successful.

  Example:
    <code>

    uint8_t myBuffer[MY_BUFFER_SIZE];

    is re-assigned to another read or write request. It is recommended that this
    function be called regularly in order to track the command status correctly.

    The application can alternatively register an event handler to receive read or
    write operation completion events.

  Preconditions:
    The DRV_SDCARD_Initialize() routine must have been called.

    The DRV_SDCARD_Open() must have been called to obtain a valid opened device handle.

  Parameters:

  Summary:
    Allows a client to identify an event handling function for the driver to

  Description:
    This function allows a client to identify an event handling function for
    the driver to call back when queued operation has completed.  
    When a client queues a request for a read or a write operation, it is provided 
    with a handle identifying the buffer that was added to the driver's buffer queue.
    The driver will pass this handle back to the client by calling "eventHandler"
    function when the queued operation has completed.
    
    The event handler should be set before the client performs any read or write
    operations that could generate events. The event handler once set, persists
    until the client closes the driver or sets another event handler (which could
    be a "NULL" pointer to indicate no callback).

  Precondition:
    The DRV_SDCARD_Initialize() routine must have been called for the specified
    SDCARD driver instance.

    The DRV_SDCARD_Open() routine must have been called to obtain a valid opened
    device handle.

  Parameters:
    handle       - A valid open-instance handle, returned from the driver's
                   open function

    eventHandler - Pointer to the event handler function implemented by the user
    
    context      - The value of parameter will be passed back to the client 
                   unchanged, when the eventHandler function is called. It can
                   be used to identify any client specific data object that 
                   identifies the instance of the client module (for example, 
                   it may be a pointer to the client module's state structure).

  Returns:
    None.

  Example:
    <code>
    // myAppObj is an application specific state data object.
