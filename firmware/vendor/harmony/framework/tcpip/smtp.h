  Summary:
    Module for Microchip TCP/IP Stack.
    
  Description:
    The SMTP client module in the TCP/IP Stack lets applications send e-mails 
    to any recipient worldwide. These message could include status information 
    or important alerts. Using the e-mail to SMS gateways provided by most cell 
    phone carriers, these messages can also be delivered directly to cell phone 
    handsets.

  Function:
    typedef struct TCPIP_SMTP_CLIENT_MESSAGE
    
  Summary:
    Configures the SMTP client to send a message.
    
  Description:
    This structure of pointers configures the SMTP Client to send an e-mail
    message.
    
  Parameters:
    Server -        the SMTP server to relay the message through
    Username -      the user name to use when logging into the SMTP server,
                    if any is required
    Password -      the password to supply when logging in, if any is required
    To -            the destination address for this message. May be a
                    comma-separated list of address, and/or formatted.
    CC -            The CC addresses for this message, if any. May be a
                    comma-separated list of address, and/or formatted.
    BCC -           The BCC addresses for this message, if any. May be a
                    comma-separated list of address, and/or formatted.
    From -          The From address for this message. May be formatted.
    Subject -       The Subject header for this message.
    OtherHeaders -  Any additional headers for this message. Each additional 
                    header, including the last one, must be terminated with
                    a CRLF pair.
    Body -          When sending a message from memory, the location of the
    				body of this message in memory. Leave as NULL to build 
    				a message on-the-fly.
    UseSSL -        This flag causes the SMTP client to make a secure connection to the server.
    ServerPort -    (uint16_t value) Indicates the port on which to connect to the
                    remote SMTP server.

  Remarks:
    When formatting an e-mail address, the SMTP standard format for associating a
    printable name may be used. This format places the printable name in quotation
    marks, with the address following in pointed brackets, such as "John Smith"
    <john.smith@domain.com>.

/*
  Function:
    bool TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin(void)

  Summary:
    Requests control of the SMTP client module.

  Description:
    Call this function before calling any other SMTP Client APIs.  This
    function obtains a lock on the SMTP Client, which can only be used by
    one stack application at a time.  Once the application is finished
    with the SMTP client, it must call TCPIP_SMTP_UsageEnd to release control
    of the module to any other waiting applications.

    This function initializes all the SMTP state machines and variables
    back to their default state.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Return Values:
    - true  - The application has successfully obtained control of the module
    - false - The SMTP module is in use by another application.  Call the
              TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin function again later, after returning to 
			  the main program loop
 */

//*****************************************************************************
/*
  Function:
    uint16_t TCPIP_SMTP_UsageEnd(void)

  Summary:
    Releases control of the SMTP client module.

  Description:
    Call this function to release control of the SMTP client module once
    an application is finished using it.  This function releases the lock
    obtained by TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin, and frees the SMTP client to be used by
    another application.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin returned true on a previous call.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Return Values:
    - SMTP_SUCCESS - A message was successfully sent
    - SMTP_RESOLVE_ERROR - The SMTP server could not be resolved
    - SMTP_CONNECT_ERROR - The connection to the SMTP server failed or was
        prematurely terminated

    transmission of the message.  Call this function after all the fields
    in SMTPClient have been set.

/*
  Function:
    bool TCPIP_SMTP_IsBusy(void)

  Summary:
    Determines if the SMTP client is busy.

  Description:
    Call this function to determine if the SMTP client is busy performing
    background tasks.  This function should be called after any call to
    TCPIP_SMTP_MailSend, TCPIP_SMTP_PutIsDone to determine if the stack has finished
    performing its internal tasks.  It should also be called prior to any
    call to TCPIP_SMTP_IsPutReady to verify that the SMTP client has not
    prematurely disconnected.  When this function returns false, the next
    call should be to TCPIP_SMTP_UsageEnd to release the module and obtain the
    status code for the operation.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin returned true on a previous call.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Return Values:
    - true  - The SMTP Client is busy with internal tasks or sending an
              on-the-fly message
    - false - The SMTP Client is terminated and is ready to be released

/*
  Function:
    uint16_t TCPIP_SMTP_IsPutReady(void)

  Summary:
    Determines how much data can be written to the SMTP client.

  Description:
    Use this function to determine how much data can be written to the SMTP
    client when generating an on-the-fly message.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin returned true on a previous call, and an on-the-fly
    message is being generated.  This requires that TCPIP_SMTP_MailSend was called
    with SMTPClient.Body set to NULL.

  Parameters:
    None.

  Returns:
    The number of free bytes the SMTP TX FIFO.

  Remarks:
    This function should only be called externally when the SMTP client is
    generating an on-the-fly message (i.e., TCPIP_SMTP_MailSend was called

  Summary:
    Writes a single byte to the SMTP client.
  
  Description:
    This function writes a single byte to the SMTP client.

  Precondition:
    TCPIP_SMTP_UsageBegin returned true on a previous call.

  Parameters:
    c - The byte to be written

  Return Values:
    - true  - The byte was successfully written
    - false - The byte was not written, most likely because the buffer was full

  Remarks:
    This function is obsolete and will be eventually removed.
    TCPIP_SMTP_ArrayPut and TCPIP_SMTP_StringPut should be used.

    This function cannot be used on an encrypted connection.
    It is difficult to estimate the amount of TX buffer space needed
    when transmitting byte by byte, which could cause intermediary write
    operations to the underlying TCP socket.

    This function should only be called externally when the SMTP client is
    generating an on-the-fly message (i.e., TCPIP_SMTP_MailSend was called
    with SMTPClient.Body set to NULL).

  Parameters:
    Data - The data to be written
