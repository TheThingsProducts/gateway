// TCP Maximum Segment Size for TX.  The TX maximum segment size is actually 
// governed by the remote node's MSS option advertised during connection 
// establishment.  However, if the remote node specifies an unmanageably large 
// MSS (ex: > Ethernet MTU), this define sets a hard limit so that TX buffers 
// are not overflowed.  If the remote node does not advertise a MSS 
// option, all TX segments are fixed at 536 bytes maximum.

// TCP Maximum Segment Size for RX (MSS).
// This value is advertised during TCP connection establishment
// and the remote node should obey it.
// The value has to be set in such a way to avoid IP layer fragmentation
// from causing packet loss.
// However, raising its value can enhance performance at the (small) risk of introducing 
// incompatibility with certain special remote nodes (ex: ones connected via a 
// slow dial up modem).
// On Ethernet networks the standard value is 1460.
// On dial-up links, etc. the default values should be 536.
// Adjust these values according to your network.

// Note that this setting affects all TCP sockets that are created

// When large TX bufferrs are needed, probably a dynamic, per socket approach,
// is a better choice (see TCPIP_TCP_OptionsSet function).
// The performance of a socket is highly dependent on the size of its buffers
// so it's a good idea to use as large as possible buffers for the sockets that need
// high throughput. 
// Note that some modules (like HTTP) use their own settings to specify the buffer size
