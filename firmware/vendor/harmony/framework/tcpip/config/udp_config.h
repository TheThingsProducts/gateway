// Note that this setting affects all UDP sockets that are created
// and, together with TCPIP_UDP_MAX_SOCKETS, has a great impact on
// the heap size that's used by the stack (see TCPIP_STACK_DRAM_SIZE setting).
// When large TX bufferrs are needed, probably a dynamic, per socket approach,
// is a better choice (see TCPIP_UDP_OptionsSet function).

// The maximum number of TX packets that can be queued
// by an UDP socket at a certain time.
// For sockets that need to transfer a lot of data (Iperf, for example),
// especially on slow connections this limit prevents running out of memory
// because the MAC/PHY transfer cannot keep up with the UDP packet allocation rate
// imposed by the application.
// Adjust depending on the TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_DEFAULT_TX_SIZE, the connection speed
// and the amount of memory available to the stack.
#define TCPIP_UDP_SOCKET_DEFAULT_TX_QUEUE_LIMIT   3

// The maximum number of RX packets that can be queued
// by an UDP socket at a certain time.
// Note that UDP sockets do not use their own RX buffers
// but instead use the network driver supplied packets and
// a timely processing is critical to avoid packet memory starvation
// for the whole stack.
// This symbol sets the maximum number of UDP buffers/packets that can
// be queued for a UDP socket at a certain time.
// Once this limit is reached further incoming packets are silently discarded.
// Adjust depending on the number of RX buffers that are available for the
// stack and the amount of memory available to the stack.

// by UDP sockets only.
// This improves the UDP socket throughput and is meant only for
// UDP sockets that have to sustain high TX traffic rate.
// However, this memory is not returned to the stack heap,
// it always belongs to UDP.
// A socket needs to have an option set in order to use the buffers pool
// (see the UDPSetOptions()).
// Use 0 to disable the feature.
