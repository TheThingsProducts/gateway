  Summary:
    The Berkeley Socket Distribution (BSD) APIs provide a BSD wrapper to the native 
    Microchip TCP/IP Stack APIs.
    
  Description:
    The Berkeley Socket Distribution (BSD) APIs provide a BSD wrapper to the native 
    Microchip TCP/IP Stack APIs. Using this interface, programmers familiar with
    BSD sockets can quickly develop applications using Microchip's TCP/IP Stack.

/* Function:

   Summary:
     This function creates a new Berkeley socket.

   Description:
     This function creates a new BSD socket for the Microchip
     TCP/IP stack. The return socket descriptor is used for the subsequent
     BSD operations.

   Precondition:
     BerkeleySocketInit function should be called.

   Parameters:
   af       - address family - AF_INET for IPv4, AF_INET6 for IPv6
   type     - socket type SOCK_DGRAM or SOCK_STREAM
   protocol - IP protocol IPPROTO_UDP or IPPROTO_TCP

   Returns:

/* Function:

   Summary:
    This function assigns a name to the socket descriptor.

   Description:
    The bind function assigns a name to an unnamed socket. The
    name represents the local address of the communication
    endpoint. For sockets of type SOCK_STREAM, the name of the
    remote endpoint is assigned when a connect or accept function
    is executed.

   Precondition:
    The socket function should be called.

   Parameters:
    s       - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket
    name    - pointer to the sockaddr structure containing the local address of 
	          the socket
    namelen - length of the sockaddr structure

   Returns:
    If bind is successful, a value of 0 is returned. A return
    value of SOCKET_ERROR indicates an error (and errno is set accordingly).

   Remarks:
    None.

/* Function:

   Summary:
    The listen function sets the specified socket in a listen mode.

   Description:
    This function sets the specified socket in a listen
    mode. Calling the listen function indicates that the
    application is ready to accept connection requests arriving
    at a socket of type SOCK_STREAM. The connection request is
    queued (if possible) until accepted with an accept function.
    The backlog parameter defines the maximum number of pending
    connections that may be queued.

   Precondition:
    bind() must have been called on the s socket first.

   Parameters:
    s       - Socket identifier returned from a prior socket() call.
    backlog - Maximum number of connection requests that can be queued.  Note
              that each backlog requires a TCP socket to be allocated.

   Returns:
    Returns 0 on success; otherwise returns SOCKET_ERROR (and errno is set accordingly).

//*****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    SOCKET accept(SOCKET s, struct sockaddr* addr, int* addrlen)

   Summary:
    This function accepts connection requests queued for a listening socket.

   Description:
    The accept function is used to accept connection requests
    queued for a listening socket. If a connection request is
    pending, accept removes the request from the queue, and a new
    socket is created for the connection. The original listening
    socket remains open and continues to queue new connection
    requests. The socket must be a SOCK_STREAM type socket.

   Precondition:
    The listen function should be called.

   Parameters:
    s       - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to
              socket. Must be bound to a local name and in listening mode.
    addr    - Optional pointer to a buffer that receives the address
              of the connecting entity.
    addrlen - Optional pointer to an integer that contains the
              length of the address addr

  Returns:
    If the accept function succeeds, it returns a non-negative
    integer that is a descriptor for the accepted socket.
    Otherwise, the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned (and errno is set accordingly).

  Remarks:
    None.

//*****************************************************************************
/* Function:
    int connect( SOCKET s, struct sockaddr* name, int namelen )

   Summary:
    This function connects to the peer communications end point.

   Description:
    The connect function assigns the address of the peer
    communications endpoint. For stream sockets, connection is
    established between the endpoints. For datagram sockets, an
    address filter is established between the endpoints until
    changed with another connect() function.

   Precondition:
    The socket function should be called.

   Parameters:
    s       - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket
    name    - Pointer to the sockaddr structure containing the
              peer address and port number
    namelen - Length of the sockaddr structure

   Returns:
    If the connect() function succeeds, it returns 0. Otherwise,
    the value SOCKET_ERROR is returned to indicate an error
    condition (and errno is set accordingly).
    For stream based socket, if the connection is not
    established yet, connect returns SOCKET_ERROR and
    errno = EINPROGRESS.

   Summary:
    The send function is used to send outgoing data on an already

   Description:
    The send function is used to send outgoing data on an already
    connected socket. This function is used to send a reliable,
    ordered stream of data bytes on a socket of type SOCK_STREAM
    but can also be used to send datagrams on a socket of type SOCK_DGRAM.

   Precondition:
    The connect function should be called for TCP and UDP sockets.
    Server side, accept function should be called.

   Parameters:
    s     - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket
    buf   - Application data buffer containing data to transmit
    len   - Length of data in bytes
    flags - Message flags (currently this field is not supported)

   Returns:

   Description:
    The sendto function is used to send outgoing data on a socket.
    The destination address is given by to and tolen. Both
    Datagram and stream sockets are supported.

   Precondition:
    The socket function should be called.

   Parameters:

    buf   - application data buffer containing data to transmit.
    len   - length of data in bytes.
    flags - message flags. Currently this field is not supported.
    to    - Optional pointer to the sockaddr structure containing the
		    destination address.  If NULL, the currently bound remote port and IP
            address are used as the destination.
    tolen - length of the sockaddr structure.

/* Function:
    int recv( SOCKET s, char* buf, int len, int flags )

   Summary:
    The recv() function is used to receive incoming data that has
    been queued for a socket.

   Description:
    The recv() function is used to receive incoming data that has
    been queued for a socket. This function can be used with both
    datagram and stream socket. If the available data
    is too large to fit in the supplied application buffer buf,
    excess bytes are discarded in case of SOCK_DGRAM type
    sockets.  For SOCK_STREAM types, the data is buffered
    internally so the application can retrieve all data by
    multiple calls of recvfrom.

   Precondition:
    The connect function should be called for TCP and UDP sockets.
    Server side, accept function should be called.

   Parameters:
    s     - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket
    buf   - Application data receive buffer
    len   - Buffer length in bytes
    flags - No significance in this implementation

   Returns:
	If the recv function is successful, the socket is valid and it has pending data:
    - The supplied buffer is non NULL and has non zero length, the function will return
      the number of bytes copied to the application buffer.
    - The supplied buffer is NULL or has zero length then no data will be copied and
      the function will return the number of bytes pending in the socket buffer.

    A return value of SOCKET_ERROR (-1)
	indicates an error condition (and errno set accordingly).
    errno is set to EWOULDBLOCK if there is no data pending in the socket buffer.

    A value of zero indicates socket has been shutdown by the peer.

   Parameters:
    s - Socket descriptor returned from a previous call to socket

  Returns:
    If closesocket is successful, a value of 0 is returned.
    A return value of SOCKET_ERROR (-1) indicates an error (and errno is set accordingly).
