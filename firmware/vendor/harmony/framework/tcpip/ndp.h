  Summary:
    IPv6 Internet Communication Message Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP).

  Description:
    Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP) in IPv6 is the substitute of
    as ARP (which is used in IPv4 for address resolve). NDP is used discover link local
    addresses of the IPv6 nodes present in the local link using a mix of ICMPv6
    messages and multicast addresses, stateless auto-configuration and router redirection.

  Summary:
    Confirms that a neighbor is reachable.

  Description:
    This function is used by upper-layer protocols to indicate that round-trip
    communications were confirmed with a neighboring node.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    pNetIf - The interface the neighbor is on.
    address - The address of the neighbor.

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    None.
