  Function:
    void TCPIP_ARP_Initialize(const TCPIP_STACK_MODULE_CTRL* const stackCtrl, const TCPIP_ARP_MODULE_CONFIG* arpData)

  Summary:
    Initializes the ARP module.

  Description:
    Initializes the ARP module.
    Calls can be done with the request of not tearing down the ARP cache
    This helps for ifup/ifdown sequences.
    Of course, if this is the case the memory allocated for the ARP cache
    has to be from a persistent heap.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    stackCtrl  - stack initialization parameters
    arpData    - ARP specific initialization parameters

  Returns:
    true if initialization succeeded,
    false otherwise

  Remarks:
    The request to maintain old ARP cache info (deleteOld field from the
    TCPIP_ARP_MODULE_CONFIG initialization data) is not implemented for stack
    nit/deinit sequences.  To maintain the data after the stack is completely
    deinitialized would need a persistent heap that's not yet implemented.
    The selection cannot be changed by ifup since this operation does not
    carry ARP configuration parameters (arpDate == 0).

  Summary:
    Deinitializes the ARP module.

  Description:
    Deinitializes the ARP module.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    stackCtrl  - stack initialization parameters, used by TCPIP_ARP_Initialize
                 to initialize the ARP module.

  Returns:
    None.

  Function:
    int8_t TCPIP_ARP_CallbacksRegister(struct arp_app_callbacks *app)

  Summary:
    Registering callback with ARP module to get notified about certain events.

  Description:
    This function allows end user application to register with callbacks, which
    will be called by ARP module to give notification to user-application about
    events occurred at ARP layer. For ex: when a ARP-packet is received, which is
    conflicting with our own pair of addresses (MAC-Address and IP-address).
    This is an extension for Zeroconf protocol implementation (ZeroconfLL.c)

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    app - ARP-Application callbacks structure supplied by user-application

  Returns:
    id > 0 - Returns non-negative value that represents the id of registration
             The same id needs to be used in deregistration
    -1     - When registered applications exceed MAX_REG_APPS and there is no
             free slot for registration

/*****************************************************************************
  Function:
    bool TCPIP_ARP_CallbacksDeregister(int8_t reg_id)

  Summary:
    De-Registering callbacks with ARP module that are registered previously.

  Description:
    This function allows end user-application to deregister with callbacks,
    which were registered previously.
    This is called by user-application, when its no longer interested in
    notifications from ARP-Module. This allows the other application to get
    registered with ARP-module.

  Precondition:
    None

  Parameters:
    reg_id - Registration-id returned in TCPIP_ARP_CallbacksRegister call

  Returns:
    true  - On success
    false - Failure to indicate invalid reg_id
