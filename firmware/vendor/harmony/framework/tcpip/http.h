  Function:
    uint8_t* TCPIP_HTTP_URLDecode(uint8_t* cData)

  Summary:
    Parses a string from URL encoding to plain-text.

  Description:
    This function parses a string from URL encoding to plain-text.  The following
    conversions are made: ‘=’ to ‘\0’, ‘&’ to ‘\0’, ‘+’ to ‘ ‘, and
    “%xx” to a single hex byte.

    After completion, the data has been decoded and a null terminator
    signifies the end of a name or value.  A second null terminator (or a
    null name parameter) indicates the end of all the data.

  Precondition:
    The data parameter is null terminated and has at least one extra
    byte free.

  Parameters:
    cData - The string which is to be decoded in place.

  Returns:
    A pointer to the last null terminator in data, which is also the
    first free byte for new data.

  Remarks:
    This function is called by the stack to parse GET arguments and
    cookie data.  User applications can use this function to decode POST
    data, but first need to verify that the string is null-terminated.
 */
uint8_t*  TCPIP_HTTP_URLDecode(uint8_t* cData);


//*****************************************************************************
/*
  Function:
    const uint8_t* TCPIP_HTTP_ArgGet(const uint8_t* cData, const uint8_t* cArg)

  Summary:
    Locates a form field value in a given data array.

  Description:
    This function searches through a data array to find the value associated with a
    given argument.  It can be used to find form field values in data
    received over GET or POST.

    The end of data is assumed to be reached when a null name parameter is
    encountered.  This requires the string to have an even number of
    null-terminated strings, followed by an additional null terminator.

  Precondition:
    The data array has a valid series of null terminated name/value pairs.

  Parameters:
    cData - the buffer to search
    cArg - the name of the argument to find

  Returns:
    A pointer to the argument value, or NULL if not found.

  Example:
  <code>
    void TCPIP_HTTP_Print_cookiename(HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle)
    {
        const uint8_t *ptr;
        TCP_SOCKET sktHTTP;

        else
            TCPIP_TCP_StringPut(sktHTTP, (const uint8_t*)"not set");
    }
  </code>

  Remarks:
    None.

/*
  Function:
    void TCPIP_HTTP_FileInclude(HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle, const uint8_t* cFile)

  Summary:
    Writes a file byte-for-byte to the currently loaded TCP socket.

  Description:
    This function allows an entire file to be included as a dynamic variable, providing
    a basic templating system for HTML web pages.  This reduces unneeded
    duplication of visual elements such as headers, menus, etc.

    When pHttpCon->callbackPos is 0, the file is opened and as many bytes
    as possible are written.  The current position is then saved to
    pHttpCon->callbackPos and the file is closed.  On subsequent calls,
    reading begins at the saved location and continues.  Once the end of
    the input file is reached, pHttpCon->callbackPos is set back to 0 to
    indicate completion.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle
    cFile - the name of the file to be sent

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    Users should not call this function directly, but should instead add
    dynamic variables in the form of <c>~inc:filename.ext~</c> in their HTML code
    to include (for example) the file "filename.ext" at that specified
    location.  The mpfs2.jar utility will handle the rest.

/*
  Function:
    HTTP_READ_STATUS TCPIP_HTTP_PostNameRead(HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle, uint8_t* cData, uint16_t wLen)

  Summary:
    Reads a name from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.

  Description:
    This function reads a name from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.  This function
    is meant to be called from an TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute callback to facilitate
    easier parsing of incoming data.  This function also prevents buffer
    overflows by forcing the programmer to indicate how many bytes are
    expected.  At least two extra bytes are needed in cData over the maximum
    length of data expected to be read.

    This function will read until the next '=' character, which indicates the
    end of a name parameter.  It assumes that the front of the buffer is
    the beginning of the name parameter to be read.

    This function properly updates pHttpCon->byteCount by decrementing it
    by the number of bytes read.  It also removes the delimiting '=' from
    the buffer.

  Precondition:
    The front of the TCP buffer is the beginning of a name parameter, and the rest of
    the TCP buffer contains a URL-encoded string with a name parameter
    terminated by a '=' character.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle
    cData - where to store the name once it is read
    wLen - how many bytes can be written to cData

  Returns:
    - HTTP_READ_OK - name was successfully read
    - HTTP_READ_TRUNCTATED - entire name could not fit in the buffer, so the
                            value was truncated and data has been lost
    - HTTP_READ_INCOMPLETE - entire name was not yet in the buffer, so call
                            this function again later to retrieve

  Remarks:
    None.

    HTTP_READ_STATUS TCPIP_HTTP_PostValueRead(HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle, uint8_t* cData, uint16_t wLen)

  Summary:
    Reads a value from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.

  Description:
    This function reads a value from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.  This function
    is meant to be called from an TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute callback to facilitate
    easier parsing of incoming data.  This function also prevents buffer
    overflows by forcing the programmer to indicate how many bytes are
    expected.  At least 2 extra bytes are needed in cData above the maximum
    length of data expected to be read.

    This function will read until the next '&' character, which indicates the
    end of a value parameter.  It assumes that the front of the buffer is
    the beginning of the value parameter to be read.  If pHttpCon->byteCount
    indicates that all expected bytes are in the buffer, it assumes that
    all remaining data is the value and acts accordingly.

    This function properly updates pHttpCon->byteCount by decrementing it
    by the number of bytes read.  The terminating '&' character is also
    removed from the buffer.

  Precondition:
    The front of the TCP buffer is the beginning of a name parameter, and the rest of
    the TCP buffer contains a URL-encoded string with a name parameter
    terminated by a '=' character.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle
    cData - where to store the value once it is read
    wLen - how many bytes can be written to cData

  Returns:
    - HTTP_READ_OK - value was successfully read

  Summary:
    Reads a name and value pair from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.

  Description:
    Reads a name and value pair from a URL encoded string in the TCP buffer.
    This function is meant to be called from an TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute callback to
    facilitate easier parsing of incoming data.  This function also prevents
    buffer overflows by forcing the programmer to indicate how many bytes are
    expected.  At least 2 extra bytes are needed in cData over the maximum
    length of data expected to be read.

    This function will read until the next '&' character, which indicates the
    end of a value parameter.  It assumes that the front of the buffer is
    the beginning of the name parameter to be read.

    This function properly updates the connection byteCount (see TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionByteCountGet())
    by decrementing it by the number of bytes read.  It also removes the delimiting '&' from
    the buffer.

    Once complete, two strings will exist in the cData buffer.  The first is
    the parameter name that was read, while the second is the associated
    value.

  Precondition:
    The front of the TCP buffer is the beginning of a name parameter, and the rest of
    the TCP buffer contains a URL-encoded string with a name parameter
    terminated by a '=' character and a value parameter terminated by a '&'.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle
    cData - where to store the name and value strings once they are read
    wLen - how many bytes can be written to cData

  Returns:
    - HTTP_READ_OK - name and value were successfully read
    - HTTP_READ_TRUNCTATED - entire name and value could not fit in the buffer,
                            so input was truncated and data has been lost
    - HTTP_READ_INCOMPLETE - entire name and value was not yet in the buffer,
                            so call this function again later to retrieve

  Remarks:
    This function is aliased to TCPIP_HTTP_PostValueRead, since they effectively
    perform the same task.  The name is provided only for completeness.

  Function:
    HTTP_IO_RESULT TCPIP_HTTP_GetExecute(HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle)

  Summary:
    Processes GET form field variables and cookies.

  Description:
    This function is implemented by the application developer.
    Its purpose is to parse the data received from
    URL parameters (GET method forms) and cookies and perform any
    application-specific tasks in response to these inputs.  Any
    required authentication has already been validated.

    When this function is called, the connection data buffer
    (see TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionDataBufferGet())
    contains sequential name/value pairs of strings representing the data received.
    In this format, TCPIP_HTTP_ArgGet can be used to search for
    specific variables in the input.  If data buffer space associated
    with this connection is required, connection data buffer may be overwritten
    here once the application is done with the values.  Any data placed
    there will be available to future callbacks for this connection,
    including TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute and any TCPIP_HTTP_Print_varname dynamic
    substitutions.

    This function may also issue redirections by setting the connection data
    buffer to the destination file name or URL, and the connection
    httpStatus (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionStatusSet()) to HTTP_REDIRECT.

    Finally, this function may set cookies.  Set connection data buffer to a series
    of name/value string pairs (in the same format in which parameters
    arrive) and then set the connection hasArgs (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionHasArgsSet())
    equal to the number of cookie name/value pairs.
    The cookies will be transmitted to the browser, and any future requests
    will have those values available in the connection data buffer.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle

  Returns:
    - HTTP_IO_DONE - application is done processing
    - HTTP_IO_NEED_DATA - this value may not be returned because more data
                        will not become available
    - HTTP_IO_WAITING - the application is waiting for an asynchronous
                      process to complete, and this function should be
                      called again later

  Remarks:
    This function is only called if variables are received via URL
    parameters or Cookie arguments.  This function may NOT write to the
    TCP buffer.

    This function may service multiple HTTP requests simultaneously.
    Exercise caution when using global or static variables inside this
    routine.  Use the connection callbackPos (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionCallbackPosGet())
    or the connection data buffer for storage associated with individual requests.

  Function:
    HTTP_IO_RESULT TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute(HTTP_CONN_HANDLE connHandle)

  Summary:
    Processes POST form variables and data.

  Description:
    This function is implemented by the application developer.
    Its purpose is to parse the data received from
    POST forms and perform any application-specific tasks in response
    to these inputs.  Any required authentication has already been
    validated before this function is called.

    When this function is called, POST data will be waiting in the
    TCP buffer.
    The connection byteCount (see TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionByteCountGet
    will indicate the number of bytes remaining to be received before the 
	browser request is complete.

    Since data is still in the TCP buffer, the application must call
    TCPIP_TCP_ArrayGet in order to retrieve bytes.  When this is done,
    connection byteCount MUST be updated to reflect how many bytes now
    remain.  The functions TCPIP_TCP_ArrayFind and TCPIP_TCP_Find 
    may be helpful to locate data in the TCP buffer.

    In general, data submitted from web forms via POST is URL encoded.
    The TCPIP_HTTP_URLDecode function can be used to decode this information
    back to a standard string if required.  If data buffer space
    associated with this connection is required, the connection data buffer 
    (see TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionDataBufferGet()) may be
    overwritten here once the application is done with the values.
    Any data placed there will be available to future callbacks for
    this connection,  including TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute and any
    TCPIP_HTTP_Print_varname dynamic substitutions.

    Whenever a POST form is processed it is recommended to issue a
    redirect back to the browser, either to a status page or to
    the same form page that was posted.  This prevents accidental
    duplicate submissions (by clicking refresh or back/forward) and
    avoids browser warnings about "resubmitting form data".  Redirects
    may be issued to the browser by setting the connection data buffer to the
    destination file or URL, and the connection httpStatus
    (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionStatusSet()) to HTTP_REDIRECT.

    Finally, this function may set cookies.  Set the connection data buffer
    to a series of name/value string pairs (in the same format in which parameters
    arrive), and then set the connection hasArgs (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionHasArgsSet)
    equal to the number of cookie name/value pairs.
    The cookies will be transmitted to the browser, and any future requests
    will have those values available in the connection data buffer.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle

  Returns:
    - HTTP_IO_DONE - application is done processing
    - HTTP_IO_NEED_DATA - more data is needed to continue, and this
                        function should be called again later
    - HTTP_IO_WAITING - the application is waiting for an asynchronous
                      process to complete, and this function should
                      be called again later

  Remarks:
    This function is only called when the request method is POST, and is
    only used when HTTP_USE_POST is defined.  This method may NOT write
    to the TCP buffer.

    This function may service multiple HTTP requests simultaneously.
    Exercise caution when using global or static variables inside this
    routine.  Use the connection callbackPos (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionCallbackPosGet)
    or connection data buffer for storage associated with individual requests.

  Function:

  Summary:
    Determines if a given file name requires authentication

  Description:
    This function is implemented by the application developer.
    Its function is to determine if a file being
    requested requires authentication to view.  The user name and password,
    if supplied, will arrive later with the request headers, and will be
    processed at that time.

    Return values 0x80 - 0xff indicate that authentication is not required,
    while values from 0x00 to 0x79 indicate that a user name and password
    are required before proceeding.  While most applications will only use a
    single value to grant access and another to require authorization, the
    range allows multiple "realms" or sets of pages to be protected, with
    different credential requirements for each.

    The return value of this function is saved for the current connection
    and can be read using TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionIsAuthorizedGet().
    It will be available to future callbacks, including TCPIP_HTTP_UserAuthenticate and any

    This function is implemented by the application developer.
    Its function is to determine if the user name and
    password supplied by the client are acceptable for this resource.
    This callback function can thus to determine if only specific
    user names or passwords will be accepted for this resource.

    Return values 0x80 - 0xff indicate that the credentials were accepted,
    while values from 0x00 to 0x79 indicate that authorization failed.
    While most applications will only use a single value to grant access,
    flexibility is provided to store multiple values in order to
    indicate which user (or user's group) logged in.

    The value returned by this function is stored in the corresponding connection data
    and will be available with TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionIsAuthorizedGet
    in any of the TCPIP_HTTP_GetExecute, TCPIP_HTTP_PostExecute, or 
	TCPIP_HTTP_Print_varname callbacks.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle
    cUser - the user name supplied by the client
    cPass - the password supplied by the client

  Returns:
    - <= 0x79 - the credentials were rejected
    - >= 0x80 - access is granted for this connection

  Remarks:
    This function is only called when an Authorization header is
    encountered.

    This function may NOT write to the TCP buffer.

  Summary:
    Inserts dynamic content into a web page

  Description:
    Functions in this style are implemented by the application developer.
    These functions generate dynamic content to be
    inserted into web pages and other files returned by the HTTP server.

    Functions of this type are called when a dynamic variable is located
    in a web page.  (i.e., ~varname~)  The name between the tilde '~'
    characters is appended to the base function name.  In this example, the
    callback would be named TCPIP_HTTP_Print_varname.

    The function prototype is located in your project's http_print.h, which
    is automatically generated by the mpfs2.jar utility.  The prototype will
    have uint16_t parameters included for each parameter passed in the dynamic
    variable.  For example, the variable "~myArray(2,6)~" will generate the
    prototype "void TCPIP_HTTP_Print_varname(uint16_t, uint16_t);".

    When called, this function should write its output directly to the TCP
    socket using any combination of TCPIP_TCP_PutIsReady, TCPIP_TCP_Put, TCPIP_TCP_ArrayPut,
    TCPIP_TCP_StringPut, TCPIP_TCP_ArrayPut, and TCPIP_TCP_StringPut.

    Before calling, the HTTP server guarantees that at least
    HTTP_MIN_CALLBACK_FREE bytes (defaults to 16 bytes) are free in the
    output buffer.  If the function is writing less than this amount, it
    should simply write the data to the socket and return.

    In situations where a function needs to write more this amount, it
    must manage its output state using the connection callbackPos
    (TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionCallbackPosGet/TCPIP_HTTP_CurrentConnectionCallbackPosSet).
    This value will be set to zero before the function is called.
    If the function is managing its output state, it must set this to a non-zero value before
    returning.  Typically this is used to track how many bytes have been
    written, or how many remain to be written.  If the connection callbackPos is
    non-zero, the function will be called again when more buffer space is
    available.  Once the callback completes, set this value back to zero
    to resume normal servicing of the request.

  Precondition:
    None.

  Parameters:
    connHandle  - HTTP connection handle
    wParam1 - first parameter passed in the dynamic variable (if any)
    wParam2 - second parameter passed in the dynamic variable (if any)
    ... - additional parameters as necessary

  Returns:
    None.

  Remarks:
    This function may service multiple HTTP requests simultaneously,
    especially when managing its output state.  Exercise caution when using
    global or static variables inside this routine.  Use the connection
    callbackPos or the connection data buffer for storage associated with 
	individual requests.
