<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Each provided implementation is contained in a separate source file (heap_1.c, heap_2.c, heap_3.c, heap_4.c, and heap_5.c respectively). &nbsp;Exactly one of these source files should be included in a project at a time [the heap defined by these portable layer functions will be used by the RTOS kernel even if the application that is using the RTOS opts to use its own heap implementation].</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Following below:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; heap_1 - the very simplest, does not permit memory to be freed</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; heap_2 - permits memory to be freed, but does coalescence adjacent free blocks.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; heap_3 - simply wraps the standard malloc() and free() for thread safety</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; heap_4 - include coalescence of adjacent free blocks to avoid fragmentation</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; heap_5 - similar to heap_4 but allows the heap to span multiple non-contiguous memory regions</div>

        ---help---
<div>
	<strong>FreeRTOS - Heap 1</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	heap_1 is the simplest implementation of all. It does not permit memory to be freed once it has been allocated. Despite this, heap_1.c is appropriate for a large number of embedded applications. This is because the majority of deeply embedded applications create all the tasks, queues, semaphores, etc. required when the system boots, and then use all of these objects for the lifetime of program (until the application is switched off again, or is rebooted). Nothing ever gets deleted.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The implementation simply subdivides a single array into smaller blocks as RAM is requested.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The total size of the array (the total size of the heap) is set by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE - which is defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function returns the total amount of heap space that remains unallocated, allowing the configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE setting to be optimised.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The heap_1 implementation:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Can be used if your application never deletes a task, queue, semaphore, mutex, etc. (which actually covers the majority of applications in which FreeRTOS gets used).</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Is always deterministic (always takes the same amount of time to execute) and cannot result in memory fragmentation.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Is very simple and allocated memory from a statically allocated array, meaning it is often suitable for use in applications that do not permit true dynamic memory allocation.</div>

<div>
	<strong>FreeRTOS - Heap 2</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This scheme uses a best fit algorithm and, unlike scheme 1, allows previously allocated blocks to be freed. &nbsp;It does not however combine adjacent free blocks into a single large block (it does not include a coalescence algorithm - see heap_4.c for an implementation that does coalescence free blocks).</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The total amount of available heap space is set by configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE - which is defined in FreeRTOSConfig.h.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The xPortGetFreeHeapSize() API function returns the total amount of heap space that remains unallocated (allowing the configTOTAL_HEAP_SIZE setting to be optimised), but does not provided information on how the unallocated memory is fragmented into smaller blocks.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This implementation:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Can be used even when the application repeatedly deletes tasks, queues, semaphores, mutexes, etc., with the caveat below regarding memory fragmentation.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Should not be used if the memory being allocated and freed is of a random size.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	For example:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	If an application dynamically creates and deletes tasks, and the size of the stack allocated to the tasks being created is always the same, then heap2.c can be used in most cases. However, if the size of the stack allocated to the tasks being created was not always the same, then the available free memory might become fragmented into many small blocks, eventually resulting in allocation failures. heap_4.c would be a better choice in this case.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	If an application dynamically creates and deletes queues, and the queue storage area is the same in each case (the queue storage area is the queue item size multiplied by the length of the queue), then heap_2.c can be used in most cases. However, if the queue storage area were not the same in each case, then the available free memory might become fragmented into many small blocks, eventually resulting in allocation failures. &nbsp;heap_4.c would be a better choice in this case.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The application called pvPortMalloc() and vPortFree() directly, rather than just indirectly through other FreeRTOS API functions. Could possibly result in memory fragmentation problems if your application queues, tasks, semaphores, mutexes, etc. in an unpredictable order. This would be unlikely for nearly all applications but should be kept in mind. Is not deterministic - but is much more efficient that most standard C library malloc implementations.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	heap_2.c is suitable for most small real time systems that have to dynamically create tasks.</div>

<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This implementation:</div>

<div>
	<strong>FreeRTOS - Idle task should yield</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This parameter controls the behaviour of tasks at the idle priority. It only has an effect if the preemptive scheduler is being used. &nbsp;The user&#39;s application creates tasks that run at the idle priority.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Tasks that share the same priority will time slice. Assuming none of the tasks get preempted, it might be assumed that each task of at a given priority will be allocated an equal amount of processing time - and if the shared priority is above the idle priority then this is indeed the case.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	When tasks share the idle priority the behaviour can be slightly different. When idle tasks should yield, the idle task will yield immediately should any other task at the idle priority be ready to run. This ensures the minimum amount of time is spent in the idle task when application tasks are available for scheduling. This behaviour can however have undesirable effects (depending on the needs of your application) as depicted below:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Suppose we have four tasks at the idle priority. Tasks A, B and C are application tasks. Task I is the idle task. A context switch occurs with regular period at times T0, T1, ..., T6. When the idle task yields task A starts to execute - but the idle task has already taken up some of the current time slice. &nbsp;This results in task I and task A effectively sharing a time slice. The application tasks B and C therefore get more processing time than the application task A.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This situation can be avoided by:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; If appropriate, using an idle hook in place of separate tasks at the idle priority.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Creating all application tasks at a priority greater than the idle priority.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Configuring the idle task to not yield prevents the idle task from yielding processing time until the end of its time slice. This ensure all tasks at the idle priority are allocated an equal amount of processing time - but at the cost of a greater proportion of the total processing time being allocated to the idle task.</div>

<div>
	For PIC32 parts that support a hardware floating point unit (FPU), FreeRTOS implements an optimized context switch sequence. Setting this option sets the configUSE_TASK_FPU_SUPPORT to 1. This will enable the optimized context switching code that saves the FPU registers for those tasks currently needing FPU support. Clearing this option prevents FPU support being added. If this option is selected but no hardware FPU support is available then a compilation error will be generated. This will occur if floating point support has been selected and no hardware is available on the device OR if the -msoft-float option has been passed to the command line compiler.</div>
<div>
	The FPU context is inherently quite large (a minimum of 264 bytes per interrupt nesting level per task) and so only those tasks that need FPU support should enable it. This is enabled by calling the function: portTASK_USES_FLOATING_POINT() at the very start of the task. From this point onwards all context switches will save the additional FPU registers.
<div>
	A restriction is that floating point operations can only be performed from tasks operating at the normal interrupt priority (IPL0). No floating point operations are permitted from interrupt routines as the context saving code would become prohibitively large.

<div>
	<strong>FreeRTOS - Stack overflow checking</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Each task maintains its own stack. The memory used by the task stack is allocated automatically when the task is created, and dimensioned by a parameter passed to the xTaskCreate() API function. Stack overflow is a very common cause of application instability. FreeRTOS therefore provides two optional mechanisms that can be used to assist in the detection and correction of just such an occurrence.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Note that these options are only available on architectures where the memory map is not segmented. Also, some processors could generate a fault or exception in response to a stack corruption before the RTOS kernel overflow check can occur.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The application must provide a stack overflow hook function if stack checking is enabled.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The hook function must be called vApplicationStackOverflowHook(), and have the prototype below:</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; void vApplicationStackOverflowHook( TaskHandle_t xTask, signed char *pcTaskName );</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The xTask and pcTaskName parameters pass to the hook function the handle and name of the offending task respectively.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Note however, depending on the severity of the overflow, these parameters could themselves be corrupted, in which case the pxCurrentTCB variable can be inspected directly.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Stack overflow checking introduces a context switch overhead so its use is only recommended during the development or testing phases.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Stack Overflow Detection - Method 1</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; It is likely that the stack will reach its greatest (deepest) value after the RTOS kernel has swapped the task out of the Running state because this is when the stack will contain the task context. At this point the RTOS kernel can check that the processor stack pointer remains within the valid stack space. The stack overflow hook function is called if the stack pointer contain a value that is outside of the valid stack range.This method is quick but not guaranteed to catch all stack overflows.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; Stack Overflow Detection - Method 2</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; When a task is first created its stack is filled with a known value. When swapping a task out of the Running state the RTOS kernel can check the last 16 bytes within the valid stack range to ensure that these known values have not been overwritten by the task or interrupt activity. The stack overflow hook function is called should any of these 16 bytes not remain at their initial value.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This method is less efficient than method one, but still fairly fast. It is very likely to catch stack overflows but is still not guaranteed to catch all overflows.</div>

<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS()</div>

<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; If configGENERATE_RUN_TIME_STATS is defined as 1 then the RTOS kernel will automatically call portCONFIGURE_TIMER_FOR_RUN_TIME_STATS() as it is started (it is called from within the vTaskStartScheduler() API function).

<div>
	<strong>FreeRTOS - Use the configAssert macro</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The semantics of the configASSERT() macro are the same as the standard C assert() macro.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	An assertion is triggered if the parameter passed into configASSERT() is zero. &nbsp;configASSERT() is called throughout the FreeRTOS source files to check how the application is using FreeRTOS. It is highly recommended to develop FreeRTOS applications with configASSERT() defined.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The example definition (shown below) calls vAssertCalled(), passing in the file name and line number of the triggering configASSERT() call (__FILE__ and __LINE__ are standard macros provided by most compilers).&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	vAssertCalled() is not a standard FreeRTOS function, although it is implemented in each demo program.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	configASSERT() can be defined to take whatever action the application writer deems appropriate.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	It is normal to define configASSERT() in such a way that it will prevent the application from executing any further. This if for two reasons; stopping the application at the point of the assertion allows the cause of the assertion to be debugged, and executing past a triggered assertion will probably result in a crash anyway.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Note defining configASSERT() will increase both the application code size and execution time.&nbsp;</div>

    ---help---
<div>
	<strong>FreeRTOS - Maximum system call interrupt priority</strong></div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The maximum interrupt priority from which FreeRTOS.org API functions can be called. &nbsp;Only API functions that end in ...FromISR() can be used within interrupts.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY sets the highest interrupt priority from which interrupt safe FreeRTOS API functions can be called.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	A full interrupt nesting model is achieved by setting configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY above (that is, at a higher priority level) than configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	This means the FreeRTOS kernel does not completely disable interrupts, even inside critical sections.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Further, this is achieved without the disadvantages of a segmented kernel architecture.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Note however, certain microcontroller architectures will (in hardware) disable interrupts when a new interrupt is accepted - meaning interrupts are unavoidably disabled for the short period between the hardware accepting the interrupt, and the FreeRTOS code re-enabling interrupts.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Interrupts that do not call API functions can execute at priorities above configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY and therefore never be delayed by the RTOS kernel execution.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Interrupt handling &#39;tasks&#39; can be written and prioritised as per any other task in the system. These are tasks that are woken by an interrupt. The interrupt service routine (ISR) itself should be written to be as short as it possibly can be - it just grabs the data then wakes the high priority handler task.&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	The ISR then returns directly into the woken handler task - so interrupt processing is contiguous in time just as if it were all done in the ISR itself. The benefit of this is that all interrupts remain enabled while the handler task executes.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	Ports that implement configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY take this further - permitting a fully nested model where interrupts between the RTOS kernel interrupt priority and configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY can nest and make applicable API calls. Interrupts with priority above configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY are never delayed by the RTOS kernel activity.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	ISR&#39;s running above the maximum syscall priority are never masked out by the RTOS kernel itself, so their responsiveness is not effected by the RTOS kernel functionality. This is ideal for interrupts that require very high temporal accuracy - for example interrupts that perform motor commutation. However, such ISR&#39;s cannot use the FreeRTOS API functions.</div>
<div>
	&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div>
<div>
	To utilize this scheme your application design must adhere to the following rule: Any interrupt that uses the FreeRTOS API must be set to the same priority as the RTOS kernel (as configured by the configKERNEL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY macro), or at or below configMAX_SYSCALL_INTERRUPT_PRIORITY for ports that include this functionality.</div>
